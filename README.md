# 🧭 The NoCode Vision

NoCode is not about avoiding code.
It is about removing unnecessary barriers between ideas and reality.

Today, creating software often requires navigating complex toolchains, fragile frameworks, platform-specific quirks, and constant rewrites. This complexity excludes many people and slows down even experienced developers.

NoCode exists to change that.

## 🧠 Core Idea

Describe what you want – not how the engine works.

NoCode is built around a simple principle:

Structure and intent should be declared.
Execution and optimization belong to the runtime.

Instead of writing imperative glue code, creators describe UI, behavior, and structure using a simple, readable, declarative language (SML).
The NoCodeRunner interprets this description and executes it on the target platform.

## ⚡ Event-First Scripting (No Dispatcher Boilerplate)

SMS uses a direct event style:

`on <id>.<event>(...) { ... }`

That means no long dispatcher chains, no `if / else if` routing blocks, and no event-to-handler glue code you need to maintain manually.

Instead of this:
- receive generic event
- parse ids and event names
- route with if/else
- call business logic

you write this:

```sml
MenuBar {
    Menu {
        id: file
        title: "File"

        Item { id: saveAs text: "Save As..." }
    }
}
```

```sms
on saveAs.clicked() {
    log.info("Save As clicked")
    // your save-as flow here
}
```

This is one of NoCode's strongest UX advantages:
- explicit and readable
- easy for newcomers
- deterministic for tooling/AI
- fast to evolve without architecture noise

## 📐 SML: Simple, Explicit, Honest

SML is intentionally minimal and means **S**imple **M**arkup **L**anguage.
	•	No hidden magic
	•	No complex expressions
	•	No JavaScript or JSON hacks
	•	No framework lock-in

SML focuses on:
	•	structure
	•	hierarchy
	•	intent
	•	readability

It is designed to be:
	•	written by humans
	•	generated by tools
	•	understood years later

If you can read it, you can reason about it.

Sample:
```qml
Window {
	title: "My First App
	pos: 0, 0
    size: 1920, 1080

	Label { text: "Hello World" }
}
```
---

## 🔒 Separation of Concerns (By Design)

NoCode enforces a strict separation:
	•	Structure & UI → SML
	•	Behavior & Logic → native C# code
	•	Execution → NoCodeRunner

This prevents the common collapse where UI, logic, and state become tangled and unmaintainable.

---

## 🧱 Deterministic, Portable, Durable

NoCode systems are designed to be:
	•	deterministic
	•	platform-independent
	•	future-proof

SML files are plain text.
They can be versioned, diffed, reviewed, archived, and regenerated.

The same SML can be rendered:
	•	on Desktop
	•	on Mobile
	•	on Web
	•	inside game engines like Godot

without rewriting the description.

## 🛠 NoCode Is Not a Toy

NoCode is not a drag-and-drop toy for shallow demos.

It is a professional toolchain for:
	•	tools
	•	editors
	•	applications
	•	games
	•	books
	•	interactive content

Advanced users can extend the system with:
	•	native plugins
	•	WASM modules
	•	custom runners

Without breaking the simplicity of the core.

---

## 🤝 Empowering Humans, Not Replacing Them

NoCode is not about replacing developers.

It is about:
	•	enabling designers to build real software
	•	allowing developers to focus on hard problems
	•	letting AI generate structure safely
	•	giving humans full control and ownership

AI can generate SML.
Humans can read it.
Runners execute it.

No black boxes.

---

## ⏳ A Long-Term Perspective

NoCode is designed to survive trends.
	•	Frameworks will come and go
	•	Languages will change
	•	Platforms will disappear

But clear structure, explicit intent, and simple text formats endure.

NoCode aims to be:
	•	boring in the best way
	•	stable
	•	understandable
	•	adaptable

---

## 🧩 In One Sentence

NoCode is a human-first system for building software by describing intent, not fighting tools.

If you want, next we can:
	•	shorten this into a README version
	•	turn it into a Manifest
	•	adapt it for developers vs non-devs
	•	or write a “What NoCode is NOT” section
