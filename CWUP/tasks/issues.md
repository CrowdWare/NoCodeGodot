## Docking Panel
The Docking Panel uses too much space ohne to show the docking menu. The button should be placed at the same level as the tabs on the right size.
Docking Space must be fixed. The center area should fill the whole free space, wehen setting width property of the DockPanels. With of center panel should be ignored. Resizing the Window shall only resize the center area and not the side panels.

## MainMenu on MacOS
Its not possible to added a propertes/setting menuitem into the existing programm menu. Also its not possible to change the text of the menuitem, specifying the same menu in SML again.
