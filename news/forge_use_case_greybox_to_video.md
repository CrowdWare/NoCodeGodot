## A Forge Use Case

When building applications, scenes, or interactive layouts, the first step is often a **greybox**.

Simple geometry.  
Basic layout.  
No styling.

Greyboxing is fast and extremely useful for exploring structure and interaction.

But greyboxes have a problem.

They are great for developers — but often difficult for others to understand.

A client, designer, or stakeholder usually cannot easily imagine the final visual result from a greybox alone.

## The Traditional Approach

Traditionally, turning a greybox into something visually presentable requires a lot of manual work.

For example:

- creating assets
- building textures
- setting up lighting
- rendering scenes
- editing videos

This process can take hours or days.

---

## A Different Idea

Forge explores a different pipeline.

Instead of manually producing a final visual version, a greybox scene can be passed through an **AI styling pipeline**.

The idea is simple:

GreyBox → AI → Styled Video

---

## The Forge Pipeline

In Forge the process can look like this:

Forge Scene  
↓  
GreyBox Export  
↓  
Forge CLI  
↓  
Grok Video Styling  
↓  
Styled Video Output

A greybox scene is exported from Forge and processed by a CLI tool.

The CLI communicates with Grok, which applies a visual style to the generated frames or video.

The result is a styled visualization of the scene without requiring a full production pipeline.

## Why This Is Interesting

This approach can be useful in several scenarios:

- application previews
- UI mockups
- game scene previews
- architectural visualization
- storyboards

Instead of building a full final scene, developers can quickly generate a styled preview.

---

## Not Just for Games

While the idea may sound similar to game previsualization, the same concept can also apply to application development.

Because Forge describes applications using structured scene definitions (SML) and scripts (SMS), these scenes can be reused for different pipelines.

One of them is visualization.

## Forge as a Platform

Forge was originally designed as a platform for building applications **without the traditional web stack**.

But once a system has:

- a scene description language
- a scripting language
- a runtime

new pipelines become possible.

GreyBox → AI styled video is one of those experiments.
