## Workflow
- Before making any changes, outline your plan and wait for explicit approval
- List all files you intend to modify
- Only proceed after I confirm with "yes" or "go ahead"

## Documentation
- After every change, update /tools/*.gd and /tools/specs/* which we use to generate documentations.
- Build documentation using ./run_runner.sh docs
